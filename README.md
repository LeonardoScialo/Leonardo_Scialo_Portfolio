# Project 1: Machine Learning Projects From Scratch
Each project in this list is written in Python, where the underlining algorithm is written solely using **built-in** Python modules and **numpy**, utilising vector notation for efficient computational analysis.

## [Project 1.1: Linear Regression](https://github.com/LeonardoScialo/Linear_Regression)
* Linear regression model on a salary dataset;
* Estimates the expected salary based on the emplyee's level with 30 samples;
* Outputs a graph of the cost vs the number of iterations, along with the number of iterations it took to converge:

* Outputs a graph of the data along witht the regression line:

* Outputs the R^2 to show how well the data fits the model.


## [Project 1.2: Logistic Regression](https://github.com/LeonardoScialo/Logistic_Regression)
* Logistic regression model on a diabetes dataset;
* Dataset has 8 features and 768 samples which are used to estimate if a patient has diabetes;
* Outputs a graph of the cost vs the number of iterations, along with the number of iterations it took to converge:

* Outputs a confusion matrix written in Python using **numpy**:

* Outputs accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## [Project 1.3: Naive Bayes](https://github.com/LeonardoScialo/Naive_Bayes)
* Naive Bayes classifier on the iris dataset;
* Dataset classifies the 3 types of iris species by using 4 features and 150 samples;
* Calculates the normal distribution for each entry for each feature;
* Outputs the accuracy;
* Planning on developing and include a confusion matrix for Naive Bayes.
